# departure-mode-classifier
This project was developed as part of my internship and focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to classify the **departure mode** of shipping containers as either **TRUCK** or **TRAIN**. The project demonstrates practical use of feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using real-world logistics data.
